### How the App is Organized

### How to Use this App

This app is simple.  It connects to the Mysql database and prints out the database in a clean table.  Then it prompts the user to select an item they would like to buy and the amount.  It checks to see if there is that quantity in stock.  If so, it totals the cost for the user.  If not, it informs the user how much is left in stock.  The stock for each item updates once a user purchases that item.
